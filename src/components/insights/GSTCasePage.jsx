          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={{ color: "black" }}>
            In a ruling with implications for procedural fairness, the Delhi
            High Court granted a fresh hearing to M/s Jinender Paper Mart, whose
            GST registration was cancelled without a fair opportunity to
            respond. The case also touches on the pending Supreme Court verdict
            regarding the validity of key GST notifications.

            acknowledged the procedural lapse and granted a fresh hearing in
