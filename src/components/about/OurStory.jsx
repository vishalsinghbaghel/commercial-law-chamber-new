        <h2>A Legacy of Precision and Advocacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our philosophy is rooted in strategic thinking and rigorous legal
          research—crafting bespoke solutions that not only address legal
          complexities but also align with our clients’ commercial imperatives.
          We are particularly known for our formidable expertise in tax
          litigation, representing clients before the Supreme Court of India,
          various High Courts, and specialized tax tribunals such as ITAT,
          CESTAT, and VAT Tribunals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our comprehensive practice spans departmental proceedings, GST
          investigations, refund litigation, and trade remedies before DGTR and
          other international forums. With on-ground representation in every
          Indian state capital, our pan-India footprint ensures swift,
          coordinated action and local insight.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are proud of our track record in precedent-setting matters—rulings
          that have shaped jurisprudence on anti-dumping, transfer pricing,
          indirect taxes, and constitutional tax challenges.
